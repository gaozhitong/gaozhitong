### Hi there ğŸ‘‹
My name is Zhitong Gao. I have a deep passion for unraveling the mysteries of intelligence.
ğŸŒ± Currently, Iâ€™m delving into why machine learning models fail and how to address these failures effectively.
ğŸ˜„ Iâ€™m also fascinated by psychology, especially in understanding my own behaviors.
ğŸ”­ I enjoy doing research, painting, reading, swimming, and photography.
ğŸ‘¯ I enjoy connecting with and learning from people.

Feel free to reach out!
