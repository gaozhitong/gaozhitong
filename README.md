### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
My name is Zhitong Gao. I am a final-year masterâ€™s student in Computer Science at ShanghaiTech University PLUS Lab. Currently, I am also a visiting student at EPFL Computer Vision Lab. 
- ðŸ”­ My current work focuses on constructing robust and safe structure-prediction models under uncertainty.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m learning uncertainty estimation, open-world learning, probabilistic modeling, optimal transport, etc.
- ðŸ‘¯ I am always open to collaborating on projects and innovative research. Feel free to reach out for any exciting opportunities!
